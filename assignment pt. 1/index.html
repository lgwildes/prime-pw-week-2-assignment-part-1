      When I created my fullName I couldn't remember or figure out if there was a way to use both firstName + lastName and also include a space. Instead I literally wrote out 'Lydia ' and then added lastName. I'm wondering if there was a more efficient or correct way to do that step.

      I also struggle to remember to add ; at the end of my lines of code. It is difficult for me to remember since the code still runs. I want to know more about why it's essential to have semicolons.

      I'm also wondering if there's a way to shorten the length of this vsCode page I'm typing in currently because if I just keep typing it's one long line. It's not very helpful for reading my text. 
      Or can I only just manually hit return?
